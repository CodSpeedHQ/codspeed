# Perf File Corruption Investigation

## File
`/home/guillaume/cod-2314/profile.pPMUwlf7Pu.out/perf.pipedata`
- Size: 4,445,779,093 bytes (4.14 GiB)
- Format: `PERFILE2` pipe mode (little-endian)
- Pipe header: 16 bytes (magic=`PERFILE2`, size=16)

## Symptom
```
thread 'main' panicked at src/executor/wall_time/perf/parse_perf_file.rs:70:9:
Failed to read record at index 3423125: The specified size in the perf event header was smaller than the header itself
```
(`perf script` also fails with the same kind of error.)

The `record_index` in the panic (3,423,125) counts **EventRecords successfully returned by the sorter** before the failure. Confirmed via two independent methods:

1. **`src/bin/count_event_records.rs`**: running the actual `linux-perf-data` library and counting EventRecords until the first error yields exactly 3,423,125.
2. **Instrumented library log**: adding an `eprintln!` in `linux-perf-data/src/file_reader.rs` at the `InvalidPerfEventSize` error site reports `read_offset=0x8b14cd00`. This is a relative offset (from after the pipe header + metadata records). Converting to absolute: `16 (pipe header) + 5888 (metadata) + 0x8b14cd00 = 0x8b14e410` — exactly the raw file offset our scanner found. **The bad record is definitively the same one.**

## Root Cause

### Found: A `PERF_RECORD_COMPRESSED2` record with `size=0`

Raw scan of the file (walking header by header) found the first invalid record at:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Raw record index | 730,541 |
| Byte offset | `0x8b14e410` (2,333,402,128 bytes into the file) |
| `type` | 83 = `PERF_RECORD_COMPRESSED2` |
| `misc` | 0 |
| `size` (u16) | **0** (invalid: must be ≥ 8) |
| `data_size` (next 8 bytes at `0x8b14e418`) | `0xffef` = **65,519** |

### Kernel Bug: u16 overflow in `builtin-record.c`

The bug is in `tools/perf/builtin-record.c:672`:

```c
event->data_size = compressed - sizeof(struct perf_record_compressed2);
event->header.size = PERF_ALIGN(compressed, sizeof(u64));  // BUG: u16 overflow
```

`compressed` is the total byte count returned by `zstd_compress_stream_to_records`, which includes the 16-byte struct header plus the zstd output. `PERF_ALIGN` rounds it up to 8-byte alignment and the result is assigned to `header.size`, which is a `__u16` (max 65,535).

`max_record_size` is computed as:
```c
// tools/perf/util/event.h
#define PERF_SAMPLE_MAX_SIZE (1 << 16)  // = 65536

// builtin-record.c
size_t max_record_size = PERF_SAMPLE_MAX_SIZE - sizeof(struct perf_record_compressed2) - 1;
//                     = 65536 - 16 - 1 = 65519
```

The `-1` was intended to prevent overflow, but it only caps the zstd output. The alignment step happens **after**:

```
compressed = 16 (struct header) + output.pos (zstd bytes, max 65519)
           = max 65535

PERF_ALIGN(65535, 8) = 65536

(u16)65536 = 0  ← BUG
```

Any `compressed` value in `[65529, 65535]` triggers this: `PERF_ALIGN` rounds up to 65536, which wraps to 0 in `__u16`.

For our specific record: `compressed = 65535` → `PERF_ALIGN = 65536` → `header.size = 0`. The `data_size` field (`65519`) is computed correctly and is trustworthy — it's just `compressed - 16`.

### Why Ubuntu 24.04 / kernel 6.17 and not 22.04 / kernel 6.5

- Kernel **6.5** (Ubuntu 22.04 AWS) predates `PERF_RECORD_COMPRESSED2` → uses only `PERF_RECORD_COMPRESSED` (type 81), which has no `data_size` field and a different size calculation that doesn't hit this overflow → works fine.
- Kernel **6.17** (Ubuntu 24.04 AWS) introduced `PERF_RECORD_COMPRESSED2` (type 83) with the buggy alignment assignment → triggers the u16 overflow when compressed output is large enough.

## Fix / Workaround

### Kernel fix
In `tools/perf/builtin-record.c:672`, cast to a wider type before aligning:
```c
event->header.size = (u16)PERF_ALIGN(compressed, sizeof(u64));
// Should assert or clamp: aligned value must fit in u16
```
Or cap `max_record_size` to ensure `PERF_ALIGN(16 + max_record_size, 8) <= 65535`.

### Parser workaround (in `linux-perf-data`)
When a `PERF_RECORD_COMPRESSED2` record has `header.size < 8`, recover the actual size from the `data_size` field (next 8 bytes):
```
actual_size = PERF_ALIGN(sizeof(perf_record_compressed2) + data_size, 8)
            = PERF_ALIGN(16 + data_size, 8)
```
Since `data_size` is set correctly (`compressed - 16`), this gives the right number of bytes to consume.
